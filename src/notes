/////// RULES ///////
~~~ How the game works ~~~
*** Overview ***
- Drac knows where Hunters are
    - Hunters do not

- if hunter enters into trial (last 6 moves) of dracula they can determine when he was there 

*** The fine print ***
-Every 13 rounds Drac leaves an immature vampire 
    - if hunter finds sleeping immature vampire then he can kill it

- Drac puts T or V when he enters a city 

- if (hunter life pts == 0) teleport to hospital to get full health 

- if (drac health == 0) dead

- hunter can only move by road, rail or sea 

- Drac only road & sea
    - Loses 2 life every turn he is at sea

-moving by road moves my 1 single segment 

-moving by rail is random and can move you 0..3 segments 

- H and D cannot encounter each other at sea 
    -H knows when D is at sea and when he lands in a city 

*** Poor Dracular ***
- D cannot move to a place in his trail EXCEPT: 
    - HIDE move and can remain in the same city for a 2nd turn. No hiding @ sea. 
        - Only 1 HIDE in his trail 

    - DOUBLE_BACK move which lets him revisit a city BUT H will know he has done so. 


~~~ RULES OF THE GAME ~~~
*** SCORE *** 
- Read spec 

*** DRACULA ***
- Has 40 life 
- loses 10 for encounter w/ H
- loses 2 if at sea
- Can gain 10 if @ Castle & he can exceed 40 life 
- 0 life means game ends and score is final

*** HUNTERS ***
- 4 hunters
- each 9 life 
- if enctr a T lose 2 life 
- if enctr D lose 4 life 
- gains 4 life if stays in same city 
- cannot exceed 9 life 

*** SEQUENCE OF PLAY ***
- Each character has a MOVE and an ACTION 
- 1st round they can move to any location 
    - D cannot move to hospital
- End game if D life <= 0 || game score <= 0


~~~ Hunter's Turn ~~~
*** Hunter's Move *** 
- ROAD MOVE: can move to any directly connected city 
- SEA MOVE: can move from a:
    - port to an adjacent sea
    - sea to adjacent sea
    - sea to an adjacent port
- RAIL MOVES: max distance moved == round number (0..366) + H# (0..3) [check the spec, it doesn't really make sense ... ] 
    - If you move more than 1 city you don't go into intermediate cities

*** Hunter's Action *** 
START OF ACTION
- if (H in city in D's trail) - ALL H can see positions in trails that have moves 
- if H in a city he will enctr: 
    1. all the traps first 
    2. any immature vampires 
    3. then dracula himself 
        - all these occur until he dies or all enctrs have occurred
        - if immature vampire is enctred it is killed w/ no effect to H. 
        - if D is enctred he loses 10 blood pts and H loses 4 life 
- If hunter life <= 0 then teleports to hospital 
    - next turn they have 9 life pts 
    - teleport does not show up in game history; players will have to deduce they are in hospial

END OF ACTION 
- if H stays in same city they are resting and gain 3 life 


~~~ Dracula's Turn ~~~
- H can see D's location when he ends his turn in the castle or in city of the H 
    - even if recent move was HIDE
    - even if H is at location that D had moved to, no enctr, b/c enctr occurs in the action part of H's turn 

*** Dracula's Move *** 
- If (trail == 6 moves) oldest MOVE-- 
    - When move leaves a trail its: 
        - Trap vanishes 
        - Vampire has matured 

- If (! Legal move for D) teleport to castle

- (! teleport move) == LOCATION || HIDE || DOUBLE_BACK
    - LOCATION move != recent 5 locations 
    - LOCATION move != adjacent rail 
    - LOCATION move != hospitals  

- HIDE move == stays in same city at start of turn
    - if (HIDE move in trail) cannot make hide move
    - cannot hide @ sea

- DOUBLE_BACK == move to location adjacent && in trail 
    - if (D_B in trail) cannot D_B
    - if (D_B)
        - H knows recent move is D_B 
        - H knows position in the trial of the location he D_B to

*** Dracula's Action *** 
- D curr MOVE is in trail 
- if (D in sea) hunters know he is in sea && D loses 2 health 
- If (D is in city) places enctr:   // even if HIDE || D_B || teleport 
    - enctr == (T || V)
        - if (D in city && (round % 13 == 0)) enctr == V 
        - else if (T < 3) enctr = T
    - enctr cannot be placed @ sea
- Game score is reduced by 1


~~~ SPECIAL RULES ~~~
*** Research *** 
- if (H == rests && other hunters recently rested && more than 6 moves in trail) 
    - 6th move in trail is revealed 

*** HIDE or D_B moves 
- if (H == city w/ HIDE or D_B in trail) all H know the move was HIDE or D_B,and they also learn the nature of the move to which the HIDE or D_B relates 

- If (research = city w/ HIDE or D_B in trail) same as above

- H can see whenever the 6th move in trail was a HIDE, but they do not learn the nature of the move to which it relates 

*** No more secrets ***
- H can co-operate using messages to communicate
- D can hear everything 

~~~ EXTRA RULES ~~~ 
- D cannot place an enctr if more than 3
