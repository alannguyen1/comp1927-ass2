/////// RULES ///////
~~~ How the game works ~~~
*** Overview ***
- Drac knows where Hunters are
    - Hunters do not

- if hunter enters into trial (last 6 moves) of dracula they can determine when he was there 

*** The fine print ***
-Every 13 rounds Drac leaves an immature vampire 
    - if hunter finds sleeping immature vampire then he can kill it

- Drac puts T or V when he enters a city 

- if (hunter life pts == 0) teleport to hospital to get full health 

- if (drac health == 0) dead

- hunter can only move by road, rail or sea 

- Drac only road & sea
    - Loses 2 life every turn he is at sea

-moving by road moves my 1 single segment 

-moving by rail is random and can move you 0..3 segments 

- H and D cannot encounter each other at sea 
    -H knows when D is at sea and when he lands in a city 

*** Poor Dracular ***
- D cannot move to a place in his trail EXCEPT: 
    - HIDE move and can remain in the same city for a 2nd turn. No hiding @ sea. 
        - Only 1 HIDE in his trail 

    - DOUBLE_BACK move which lets him revisit a city BUT H will know he has done so.
